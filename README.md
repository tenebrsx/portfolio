# 🧠 Neural Portfolio - Angel's Mind Map

**An interactive brain-like portfolio where ideas connect like neurons.**

Welcome to my mind. This isn't just another portfolio—it's a living, breathing neural network that represents how I think, build, and create.

## 🎯 The Vision

> "Hi, I'm Angel. I like creating stuff."

At my core, I'm just a builder. This portfolio reflects that builder mentality through:

- **Interactive Neural Network**: Projects and ideas floating like neurons in a brain
- **Drag & Connect**: Explore my work by dragging nodes and discovering connections
- **Collaborative Creation**: Double-tap anywhere to add your own ideas to my neural network
- **"Hire The Mind"**: A unique CTA that invites collaboration rather than just showcasing

## ✨ Features

### 🧬 Neural Interface
- **Draggable Nodes**: Each project is a neuron you can move around
- **Real-time Physics**: Nodes respond to forces, avoiding collisions naturally
- **Neural Connections**: Visual links between related projects and concepts
- **Smooth Animations**: Powered by custom physics simulation

### 💡 Interactive Ideation
- **Add Ideas**: Double-tap or click the + button to contribute your vision
- **Collaborative**: Users can add their own project ideas to the brain
- **Real-time Integration**: New ideas instantly become part of the neural network

### 🎨 Immersive Experience
- **Loading Sequence**: Typewriter effect with neural background animations
- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: Dark theme with neural blue (#00d9ff) accents
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across all devices
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### 💼 "Hire The Mind" CTA
- **Unique Positioning**: Not just "contact me" but "hire the mind"
- **Detailed Form**: Project type, budget, timeline collection
- **Neural Success Animation**: Confirmation with pulsing neural effects

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React 18**: Modern hooks-based architecture
- **Custom Physics**: Hand-built simulation for node interactions
- **SVG Canvas**: Smooth vector graphics for connections and nodes
- **CSS-in-JS**: Styled-jsx for component-scoped styling
- **Modern CSS**: CSS Grid, Flexbox, custom properties
- **Vanilla JS**: No heavy dependencies, optimized performance

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd portfolio

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The neural network will initialize at `http://localhost:3000`

### Build for Production

```bash
# Create optimized build
npm run build

# The build folder contains the production-ready files
```

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Loading Experience**: Watch the typewriter effect introduce Angel
2. **Explore Nodes**: Click and drag project nodes around the brain
3. **View Projects**: Click on project nodes to see detailed information
4. **Add Ideas**: Double-tap empty space or click the + button
5. **Hire The Mind**: Click the neural CTA to start a collaboration

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding Projects

Edit the `projectData` array in `BrainInterface.js`:

```javascript
{
  id: 'unique-id',
  name: 'Project Name',
  type: 'project',
  description: 'What you built',
  tech: ['React', 'Node.js', 'etc'],
  x: 0.3,      // Position (0-1)
  y: 0.4,      // Position (0-1)
  size: 60,    // Node size
  color: '#00d9ff'
}
```

### Styling the Neural Network

Key CSS variables in `App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --neural-blue: #00d9ff;     /* Primary accent */
  --neural-purple: #b794f6;   /* Secondary accent */
  --neural-pink: #f093fb;     /* Idea nodes */
  --bg-primary: #0a0a0a;      /* Background */
  --connection-line: rgba(0, 217, 255, 0.2);
}
```

### Physics Simulation

Adjust node behavior in `BrainInterface.js`:

```javascript
// Gravity toward center
const force = 0.001;

// Collision detection
const minDistance = (node.size + other.size) / 2 + 20;

// Damping (velocity reduction)
node.vx *= 0.95;
```

## 🌟 The Philosophy

This portfolio embodies the builder mentality:

- **No gatekeeping**: Open source and hackable
- **Collaboration over competition**: Users can add to the neural network
- **Function follows form**: Every visual element serves the user experience
- **Continuous evolution**: The brain grows with new connections
